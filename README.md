# Weather App

This is a simple **Weather Application** built using **React** that allows users to search for weather information for different cities. The app fetches weather data such as temperature, pressure, and data age from an external weather API and displays it in a user-friendly interface. The app is responsive and optimized for different screen sizes, including mobile devices.

## Features

- **City Selection:** Predefined list of cities for quick weather lookup.
- **Search Functionality:** Users can search for any city by typing its name.
- **Weather Details:** Displays weather description, temperature (Â°C), pressure (hPa), and data age (hours).
- **Delete City:** Allows users to delete a city from the displayed list.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for different screen sizes (including mobile devices with 320px and 375px widths).
